# NickBoard(Online Notice board for IIT  Bombay)
-Apart from Academics, People of IITB are involved in many social,cultural,
sports, Extra curricular activities and so on.
- But people of IITB have no place to find all activities going on inside the institute.
- And also people creating events find different ways like Social media, posters,
promotions to encourage participation in their events but not able to analyze how
many people will come to their event.


Solution:​What we want to do!

● So for both Event creators and seekers we want to create a single platform

1. Easy to create their event with few clicks

● nickboard.iitb.ac.in for Event seekers:
